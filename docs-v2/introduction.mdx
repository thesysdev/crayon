# Crayon

Crayon is a generative UI framework. It gives your AI the ability to respond with interactive UI components — cards, charts, forms, tables — instead of just markdown.

## Get started in 30 seconds

```bash
npx create-crayon-app my-app
cd my-app && pnpm dev
```

This scaffolds a working app with GenUI rendering, a pre-built chat UI, and a backend — ready to go out of the box.

## What's in the SDK

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Generative UI" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/generative-ui/index">
    Let the LLM respond with UI instead of markdown. Register your React components with zod schemas, and Crayon handles the rest — schema generation, streaming, and rendering.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat" icon="comments" href="/chat/index">
    A pre-built, customizable chat UI with state management, thread persistence, multiple layouts, backend guides, and framework integrations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
