title: Component Registry
description: Register React components with zod schemas for type-safe, LLM-driven rendering.
---

The component registry is where you tell Crayon about your React components. Each registration pairs a component with a zod schema describing its props. Crayon uses this to:

- Generate a schema/format for the LLM so it knows what components exist and what props they accept
- Validate the LLM's output at runtime
- Provide type-safe props to your components

{/* Will cover: */}
{/* - Creating a registry */}
{/* - Registering a component with z.object() */}
{/* - Extracting the LLM schema from the registry */}
{/* - Passing the schema to your backend/LLM call */}
