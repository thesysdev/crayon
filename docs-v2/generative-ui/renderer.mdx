description: Parses GenUI Lang output and renders registered components, with streaming support.
---

The renderer is the bridge between the LLM's GenUI Lang output and your React components. It takes the LLM response, looks up components in the registry, and renders them.

{/* TODO: Add implementation details once GenUI Lang PR lands */}
{/* Will cover: */}
{/* - Using the renderer component */}
{/* - How it resolves components from the registry */}
{/* - Streaming / partial response rendering */}
{/* - Error handling (unknown components, invalid props) */}
