title: GenUI Lang
description: A subset of JavaScript designed as an LLM output format for generating UI.
---

GenUI Lang is the language the LLM uses to respond with UI. It's a subset of JavaScript — simple enough for LLMs to produce reliably, expressive enough to compose components with props and nesting.

{/* TODO: Add syntax reference and examples once GenUI Lang PR lands */}
{/* Will cover: */}
{/* - What the language looks like (syntax examples) */}
{/* - Supported constructs (components, props, nesting, expressions) */}
{/* - Why a JS subset (vs JSON, vs full JSX) */}
{/* - How it streams (partial output handling) */}
