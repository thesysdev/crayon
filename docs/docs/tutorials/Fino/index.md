# Personal Finance Assistant

For this tutorial, we'll build a personal finance assistant that helps the user manage their finances.

<!-- TODO: Add a gif or link for the live app -->

## Goals
- User should be able to chat with the assistant and ask questions about their personal finance history.
- Answers should be well designed and interactive rather than overloading the user with a lot of text.
- User should be able to create and manage multiple chat threads.

## Setup

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/quickstart/python-fastapi) guide to set up your project.
