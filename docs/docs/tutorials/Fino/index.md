# Personal Finance Assistant

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a personal finance assistant that helps you manage your finances.

<!-- TODO: Add a gif or link for the live app -->

## Goals
- You should be able to chat with the assistant and ask questions about your personal finance history.
- Your answers should be well-designed and interactive, rather than overloading you with much text.
- You should be able to create and manage multiple chat threads.

## Setup

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/quickstart/nextjs) guide to set up your project.

## Next Steps
- Add a system prompt to your assistant to answer questions about your personal finance history.
- Add a SQL execution tool to your assistant to analyze your personal finance history.
- Add a template to your assistant to render your personal finance history in a structured format.
- Render the template in the frontend based on the parameters returned by the LLM.
