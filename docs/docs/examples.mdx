## Simple Cookbook

A TypeScript-based cookbook application that showcases how to integrate Crayon with Next.js. This example demonstrates:

- Recipe generation using AI
- Structured output handling for ingredients and instructions
- Real-time recipe generation
- Integration with OpenAI's API

<button
  className="button button--primary"
  onClick={() =>
    window.open(
      "https://github.com/thesysdev/examples/tree/main/crayon/simple-cookbook",
      "_blank"
    )
  }
  children={<>View Simple Cookbook Example →</>}
/>

## Fino Crayon

A Next.js project that demonstrates more advanced usage of Crayon by building a personal finance assistant. This example demonstrates:

- Cutomizing the Crayon UI by using individual components and `ChatProvider` instead of the pre-built `CrayonChat` component.
- Database integration with Prisma
- Full-stack implementation

<button
  className="button button--primary"
  onClick={() =>
    window.open(
      "https://github.com/thesysdev/examples/tree/main/crayon/fino-crayon",
      "_blank"
    )
  }
  children={<>View Fino Crayon Example →</>}
