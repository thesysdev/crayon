# Streaming Protocol

To enable streaming of both text and UI, Crayon uses a standard
streaming protocol that utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE). This protocol defines the format of the data that is sent to the client. It is a simple text stream with specific event types that is agnostic of the backend language or the LLM model used.

You can implement this protocol in your custom backend and integrate it with Crayon to build your own. For example, you can use a Python FastAPI backend that integrates with custom models and use Crayon to build a UI for it.

## Event Types

The protocol supports several types of events as defined in the `SSEType` enum:

```typescript
export enum SSEType {
  TextDelta = "text",
  ResponseTemplate = "tpl",
  ResponseTemplatePropsChunk = "tpl_props_chunk",
  ContextAppend = "context_append",
  MessageUpdate = "message_update",
  Error = "error",
}
```

### Text Delta

A `TextDelta` represents a unit of text in the stream:

```typescript
event: text
data: <text content>
```

Multiple consecutive text deltas are appended to the stream as they are generated to create a single text block.

### Response Template

A `ResponseTemplate` defines a UI component to render, with a name and optional properties:

```typescript
event: tpl
data: {"name": "<template name>", "templateProps": <response template props>}
```

The template name refers to a registered UI component, and the properties are passed to that component.

### Response Template Properties Chunk

`ResponseTemplatePropsChunk` allows for streaming of the props for a response template:

```typescript
event: tpl_props_chunk
data: <response template props chunk>
```

### Context Append

`ContextAppend` adds a new context item to the conversation:

```typescript
event: context_append
data: <JSON context item>
```

### Message Update

`MessageUpdate` sends an update about a specific message by ID:

```typescript
event: message_update
data: {"id": "<message ID>"}
```

### Error

`Error` provides information about errors during streaming:

```typescript
event: error
data: <error message>
```

## Encoding

The protocol uses the `eventsource-encoder` package to properly encode the SSE events, ensuring they follow the correct format with appropriate event types and data fields.
