description: Build different chart type using recharts on top of existing chart components
---

1. List of chart types -https://gist.githubusercontent.com/venkateshwarans/f7458e5716a7876987f01c6303771c4e/raw/7b634b092eb69ef9870c326fd21adfb038f41c94/Looker%2520Studio%2520Visualizations%2520-%2520Google

Recharts documentation - https://recharts.org/en-US/api

2. I have this list of different types of charts. I already have a few chart types in @js/packages/react-ui/src/components/Charts   folder like, Bar, Area etc. 

3. I want to build the ones from the gist that are not already there in the /Charts folder. 

4. I want to follow the same code patterns and libraries, themese, colors, code structure that is used in the existing chart types /Charts folder

5. If there is a room for betterment or improvement or better libraries can be used to acheive, you are allowed to that. without breaking the existing components or logics. 

6. don't miss to create storybook

7. create a documentation for the components and its usage that you are building. 

8. Build the chart type that I ask. Once we are done with it, then we will move to next chart type..
